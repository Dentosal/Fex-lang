Some missing functions from `corefunctions`
==========================================

Math
====
* all trig missing
* pi, e (constants, but still, "constant functions")

Array
=====
* filter
* "foreach" list comprehension
* reduce??

Control
=======
There is no need for `for`, because array operations are good enough.
* if-else
* switch-case
* repeat
* while



IO
==
* readline
* full file IO system
* sockets
* `os` module interface
